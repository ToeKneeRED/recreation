# Builds the managed scripting assembly (Recreation.Scripting) that ClrHost
# hosts. The engine build never depends on .NET; this is a separate, optional
# step run when managed scripting is wanted.
#
# Usage:
#   DOTNET_ROOT=/path/to/dotnet ./tools/build_managed.sh [output_dir]
#
# DOTNET_ROOT must point at a .NET root containing the dotnet CLI and the shared
# framework (e.g. a nix dotnet-sdk's share/dotnet). Output defaults to
# build/managed; pass that dir and the .runtimeconfig.json to pexrun hosttest.
#
# The optional default gamemodes (the per-game rulesets) build as separate
# assemblies into <out>/gamemodes; the host preloads that dir at boot. Delete one
# to drop a game, or pass RECREATION_NO_GAMEMODES=1 at run time to skip them all.
