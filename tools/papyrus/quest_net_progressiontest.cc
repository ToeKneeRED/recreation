// quest_net_progressiontest: an end-to-end check that a server's quest
// progression replicates to a client over the QuestReplicator delta path.
// A server-side QuestSystem is driven stage by stage (start, advance, display
// then complete an objective, reach the completing stage) and after each
// mutation its AllStatuses() snapshot is run through QuestReplicator::Build and
// ApplyQuestUpdate into a SEPARATE client-side QuestSystem. The client must
// mirror the server at every step. No game data and no sockets are needed
// (QuestDef is built by hand, and the replicator/apply operate on byte blobs
// directly), so it runs in the ctest gate.
