# Changelog

All notable changes to Recreation are documented here. The main menu's NEWS rail
shows the most recent entries (the first bullet of each release is its headline).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-23
### Added
- FiveM-style asset streaming: a server distributes its mods to players on join
- The host catalogs a mods directory (--mods-dir); clients pull only the content
  they are missing into a content-addressed cache, then mount it into the asset Vfs
- Scripting RPC channel woven into multiplayer: C# mods emit and receive calls
  (Rpc.Emit / Rpc.ToClient / Rpc.Broadcast / Rpc.On) over the session
- A ClientAssetsReady event fires server-side once a player finished downloading,
  so mods can gate spawn or greet the player when their UGC has arrived
