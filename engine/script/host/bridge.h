// The C ABI the .NET host (the user-facing "main" world where mods live) calls
// to reach the engine through its Papyrus guest. The managed side mirrors these
// layouts exactly (Recreation.Scripting, Interop/*). The two worlds share
// nothing but this table of function pointers and an opaque context, which keeps
// them cleanly separated: managed code never sees a VM type, the VM never sees a
// CLR type.
//
// Design: a value-based dispatch surface. Rather than one C function per game
// API, the bridge marshals a dynamically typed value (ApiValue) and routes
// calls through the VM's CallGlobal/CallMethod. Those already fall back to the
// engine's native registry, so a single pair of dispatch functions exposes the
// entire game API (Game.GetPlayer, Actor.GetActorValue, ObjectReference.MoveTo,
// ...) plus any loaded Papyrus script function. New game functionality needs no
// new bridge entry: it is reachable the moment the engine registers the native.
//
// Stability: only ever append fields to ScriptBridge and values to ApiKind.
// Reordering or inserting breaks managed builds compiled against an older
// layout. All strings are UTF-8, null terminated. Object handles are opaque
// (0 means none/failure).

// The kind tag of an ApiValue. Mirrors papyrus::ValueType for the kinds that
