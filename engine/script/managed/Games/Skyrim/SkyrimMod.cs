// game-agnostic SDK. The mod host discovers this like any other mod and runs
// OnLoad once at boot, where it brings each Skyrim system online.
//
// As more games land, this is gated on the active game profile so it installs
// only under Skyrim; until the engine exposes that, it registers unconditionally
// in this Skyrim-targeted build.
