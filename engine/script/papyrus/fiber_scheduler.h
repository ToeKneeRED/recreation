// to completion immediately; one that suspends is parked with a deadline and

//
// Single-threaded: every method runs on the guest thread, the only place the VM
// executes. `take_request` returns the suspending activation's wait (the VM's
// TakeLatentRequest), queried right after a fiber yields.
//
// In-session only: a parked fiber holds its continuation on a live stack, which
// cannot be serialized. A save captured mid-Wait therefore loses the pending wait.
// TODO: to persist parked activations across a save, snapshot each suspended
// activation's frame stack (script, function, ip, locals per frame) as data and
// resume it via a stackless path. Needs a savegame system first; the timer and LOS
// registrations in PapyrusGuest are already serializable and would persist first.
