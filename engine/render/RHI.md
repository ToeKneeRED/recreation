# Render Hardware Interface (RHI)

The renderer is written against the backend-agnostic API in `render/rhi/` —
no pass, system or public header may name a Vulkan/D3D12/console type. Each
backend lives in its own directory and translates:

```
render/rhi/        public API: types.h resources.h bindings.h pipeline.h
                   command_list.h device.h swapchain.h  (+ vulkan_interop.h)
render/vulkan/     Vulkan 1.3 backend (dynamic rendering, sync2, BDA baseline)
render/d3d12/      D3D12 backend (windows d3d12.dll / linux vkd3d; see below)
render/null/       no-op backend: headless/serverside + interface conformance
```

Backend selection: `DeviceDesc::backend` (`kAuto` → platform native, then
Vulkan, then null). Build flags `RECREATION_RHI_VULKAN` / `RECREATION_RHI_D3D12`
gate compilation; the null backend always builds.

## Core model

- **Device** (`rhi/device.h`): resource + pipeline creation, frame ring
  (`BeginFrame(slot)` / `SubmitFrame`), `ImmediateSubmit` for uploads. Owns all
  sync primitives — nothing above the RHI touches fences or semaphores.
- **CommandList** (`rhi/command_list.h`): recording. Dynamic-rendering-style
  raster (`BeginRendering` auto-sets viewport/scissor), compute, transfers,
  acceleration-structure builds, timestamps, debug labels.
- **Resources** (`rhi/resources.h`): `GpuBuffer`/`GpuImage` are value types
  holding an opaque backend handle plus mirrored metadata (`size`, `mapped`,
  `address`, `format`, `extent`). Copies alias; destroy exactly once via the
  Device.
- **Pipelines** (`rhi/pipeline.h`): descriptor-driven. A pass declares its
  binding slots inline in the desc; the backend derives and caches set/pipeline
  layouts. Shared sets (bindless, frame globals) pass a `BindingLayoutHandle`.
- **Bindings** (`rhi/bindings.h`): transient per-record sets via
  `cmd->BindTransient(set, {Bind::Storage(0, img), ...})` (replaces the
  allocate/update/bind descriptor dance); persistent sets via
  `Device::CreateBindingSet` + `UpdateBindingSet` (bindless registry).
- **States** (`rhi/types.h`): images move between coarse `ResourceState`s
  (`kGeneral`, `kShaderRead*`, `kColorTarget`, ...). The render graph derives
  inter-pass barriers; manual transitions use
  `cmd->Barrier(Transition(img, before, after))`. Buffer hazards use coarse
  scopes: `cmd->MemoryBarrier(BarrierScope::kComputeWrite, BarrierScope::kIndirectArgs)`.
- **Shaders**: HLSL compiled by dxc, dual-target: SM 6.6 SPIR-V always, plus
  an SM 6.5 DXIL sidecar when the d3d12 backend is built (see the D3D12
  section). `REC_SHADER(k_foo_cs_hlsl)` wraps both as one `ShaderBlob`; pass
  code does not change per backend.
- **Samplers**: `device.GetSampler(SamplerDesc{...})` — cached, never destroyed
  by callers.
- **Ray tracing**: ray queries only (no RT pipelines/SBT). `AccelTriangles`,
  `TlasInstance` (layout-identical between VK and D3D12) and
  `Device::CreateAccelStruct`/`cmd->BuildBlas/BuildTlas`. `RayTracingContext`
  (`gi/raytracing.*`) owns BLAS/TLAS lifecycles on top.

## Migration pattern (old raw Vulkan → RHI)

| old | new |
|---|---|
| `VkDescriptorSetLayout` + `VkPipelineLayout` + `VkPipeline` members | one `PipelineHandle` |
| `MakeSetLayout` / `vkCreate*Layout` / `vkCreateComputePipelines` | `device.CreateComputePipeline({.shader, .sets, .push_constant_size, .debug_name})` |
| `vkCreateGraphicsPipelines` + `VkPipelineRenderingCreateInfo` | `device.CreateGraphicsPipeline(...)` with `color_formats`/`depth`/`blend` presets |
| `ctx.allocate_set` + `VkWriteDescriptorSet[]` + `vkUpdateDescriptorSets` + `vkCmdBindDescriptorSets` | `ctx.cmd->BindTransient(set_index, {Bind::...})` after `BindPipeline` |
| `vkCmdBindPipeline` / `vkCmdPushConstants` / `vkCmdDispatch` | `cmd->BindPipeline` / `cmd->Push(pc)` / `cmd->Dispatch2D(extent)` |
| `vkCmdBeginRendering` + viewport/scissor | `cmd->BeginRendering({extent, colors, &depth})` |
| `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2` image barrier | `cmd->Barrier(Transition(image, before, after))` |
| `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2` memory barrier | `cmd->MemoryBarrier(src_scope, dst_scope)` |
| `VkFormat` / `VkExtent2D` / `VkImageLayout` | `Format` / `Extent2D` / `ResourceState` |
| `VK_IMAGE_USAGE_*` / `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_*` | `kTextureUsage*` / `kBufferUsage*` |
| `vkCreateSampler` per pass | `device.GetSampler({...})` |
| `vkGetBufferDeviceAddress` | `buffer.address` (created with `kBufferUsageDeviceAddress`) |
| `VkAccelerationStructureKHR` param | `AccelStructHandle` (`Bind::Accel(slot, tlas)`) |

Exemplars: `screenspace/ssao.*` (compute), `gi/recon_path_tracer.*` (ray
query + history imports + shared bindless set), `gi/raytracing.*` (AS builds),
`core/bindless.*` (persistent update-after-bind set).

## Interop escape hatch

Modules that integrate API-specific SDKs — NRD, DLSS, FSR3, the runtime gui
backend, the thumbnailer — include `rhi/vulkan_interop.h` (guarded by
`RECREATION_RHI_VULKAN`) and pull raw handles via `GetVulkanHandles(device)`,
`GetVkCommandBuffer(cmd)`, `GetVkImage/GetVkImageView/...`. This keeps them
fully functional on the Vulkan backend without leaking Vulkan into the
portable surface. On other backends they must degrade gracefully (feature
unavailable), which the existing option plumbing already handles.

## D3D12 backend

Implemented in `d3d12/` (device, command list, offscreen/DXGI swapchain,
convert tables) and validated end to end on Linux by running the whole engine
over vkd3d (WineHQ vkd3d 2.0, the native D3D12-on-Vulkan library, provided by
the nix dev shell). `vkrun env REC_RHI=d3d12 ./build/nix/runtime/recreation
--demo materials --no-rt` renders the materials demo pixel-identical to the
Vulkan backend outside the stochastic cloud layer (MAE < 1/255, p99 = 0
against `REC_RHI=vulkan` with clouds pinned off).

### How it maps

- **Shaders**: every HLSL resource carries both `[[vk::binding(N, S)]]` and
  `: register(<class>N, spaceS)`; push blocks use `PUSH_CONSTANTS(T, name)`
  from `shaders/rhi_bindings.hlsli` (SPIR-V push constants / DXIL cbuffer at
  `b999, space0`). The build embeds a DXIL sidecar (`k_<sym>_dxil`) next to
  the SPIR-V when `RECREATION_RHI_D3D12` is on; the sidecar targets SM 6.5
  (vkd3d 2.0's ceiling — 6.6 DXIL is rejected; 6.5 still covers ray queries
  and mesh shaders). The DXIL is unsigned, which vkd3d accepts natively and
  Windows accepts with experimental shader models; shipping Windows builds
  would sign via dxil.dll. SPIR-V-only shaders (`vk::RawBufferLoad` users:
  the meshlet path, ray-hit shading readers) sit on the
  `RECREATION_SHADER_NO_DXIL` list and embed a null sidecar; the d3d12 device
  reports their pipelines unavailable and caps gating keeps them unreached.
- **Bindings**: one root-signature descriptor table per set for views and one
  for samplers (`space = set index`); `kStorageBuffer` slots occupy an SRV+UAV
  descriptor pair (raw views — vkd3d lowers structured access to byte ranges;
  descriptor-stride-consuming Windows hardware needs the rhi to carry element
  strides, see below). Transient sets write straight into a per-frame window
  of the shader-visible heap; persistent sets (bindless registry, material
  sets) get reserved regions with null-initialized descriptors. Sampler
  tables are content-hashed and cached forever (2048-descriptor api cap).
- **Push constants**: ≤ 64 B ride as root constants; larger blocks spill into
  a per-frame upload ring behind a root CBV, with a CPU shadow so offset
  pushes (shadow cascade matrix at 0, per-draw model at 64) keep Vulkan
  semantics.
- **Skinned meshes (REC_BDA convention)**: the skinned vertex shaders read
  the bone palette through `vk::RawBufferLoad` on SPIR-V and through a
  `ByteAddressBuffer` root SRV at `(t998, space0)` on DXIL. The backend
  detects skinned pipelines by their `BLENDINDICES` input signature and binds
  that root SRV from the u64 palette address it finds at byte 128 of the push
  block (both `mesh.vs` and `shadow.vs` keep it there).
- **Barriers**: legacy `D3D12_RESOURCE_STATES` (vkd3d 2.0 has no enhanced
  barriers). Texture states are tracked per subresource on the device record;
  buffers decay to COMMON per ExecuteCommandLists, so per-list lazy
  transitions cover copies, index/vertex/indirect/CBV/UAV use. The coarse rhi
  `MemoryBarrier` scopes lower to a global UAV barrier.
- **Orientation**: the backend records inverted viewports (negative height,
  legal in D3D12), which cancels the D3D/Vulkan NDC y-flip so the shared
  Vulkan-tuned HLSL and matrices render identically on both backends.
- **Swapchain**: DXGI flip-model on Windows (compile-guarded); on Linux an
  offscreen ring of three render targets — no display path exists through
  vkd3d, "present" is a no-op and `REC_UI_SHOT` reads frames back through the
  normal `CopyTextureToBuffer` path (with the 256-byte row-pitch staging
  shuffle D3D12 requires).
- **Copies**: committed resources only for now (suballocation via D3D12MA is
  a TODO); `BlitMip` lowers to a fullscreen draw (`shaders/util/blit.ps`),
  `FillBuffer`/`ClearColor` to UAV/RTV clears.
- **Ray tracing & mesh shaders**: prebuild info, AS creation and
  BLAS/TLAS builds are implemented against `ID3D12Device5` /
  `ID3D12GraphicsCommandList4`, mesh PSOs against `ID3D12Device2` state
  streams — all caps-gated. vkd3d 2.0 reports neither
  (`raytracing/ray_query/mesh_shaders = false`), so on Linux these paths
  compile but stay unreached; the engine's existing gating handles it.

### Running the d3d12 backend on Linux

```
nix develop            # dev shell provides vkd3d 2.0 (libvkd3d, libvkd3d-utils)
cmake -DRECREATION_RHI_D3D12=ON build/nix   # defaults ON when vkd3d is found
ninja -C build/nix recreation
vkrun env REC_RHI=d3d12 REC_UI_SHOT=/tmp/shot.png REC_UI_SHOT_FRAMES=45 \
  ./build/nix/runtime/recreation --demo materials --no-rt
```

vkd3d findings (2026-07): unsigned DXIL is accepted; the highest usable
shader model is 6.5 (`HighestShaderModel` reports 6.0, but 6.1–6.5 DXIL
creates fine and 6.6 fails); `WIDL_EXPLICIT_AGGREGATE_RETURNS` is required —
libvkd3d implements aggregate returns with the Windows out-pointer ABI.

### Windows-pending

- Runtime validation of the whole backend on real d3d12.dll (only vkd3d has
  executed it), including the DXGI swapchain, negative-viewport behaviour and
  the unsigned-DXIL experimental-features toggle.
- DXR and mesh-shader runtime validation (code paths exist, no capable
  device here reports the caps).
- Structured-buffer element strides: descriptors are raw views today, which
  vkd3d lowers correctly; hardware that indexes via the descriptor stride
  needs `BindingItem` to carry strides.
- Vulkan-interop consumers (ugui HUD/menus, imgui debug overlay, NRD, DLSS,
  FSR3, thumbnailer) degrade gracefully on d3d12 — feature-unavailable, as
  designed. A d3d12 gui backend would restore UI there.
- The meshlet/ray-hit `vk::RawBufferLoad` shaders need a descriptor-based
  port before mesh shaders / ray queries can light up on Windows.

Console backends follow the same recipe in their own directory; nothing in
pass code assumes descriptor sets, image layouts or SPIR-V.
