// database, not by a path convention, so architecture and ship materials carry
// no usable path-mirror textures on their own.
//
// The database serializes each TextureSet object as its name (a string field,
// component-type id 500) immediately followed by that set's texture file paths
// (component-type id 906), so a linear pass recovers, for every material whose
// TextureSet is named "<material>_TextureSet<n>", its base-color, normal and
// emissive maps. That covers the bulk of materials (~73%); the rest reach their
// textures through layer/edge references this reader does not follow, and fall
// back to the path convention or gray. The first texture of each kind in a set
// is the set's own; a shared placeholder trails the group and is ignored.
