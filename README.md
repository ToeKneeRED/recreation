# recreation

A modern, ECS driven game engine that loads Bethesda game content (Skyrim SE,
Fallout 4, Fallout 76) and plays it on a Vulkan rendering stack.

The engine never renders or simulates Bethesda data directly. ESM/ESL plugins,
BSA/BA2 archives, NIF meshes and legacy materials are converted into engine
native formats at load time. Everything downstream (renderer, world streaming,
networking) only knows engine formats.

## Layout

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `engine/core` | platform, logging, jobs, timing, window |
| `engine/ecs` | archetype based ECS, written from scratch |
| `engine/asset` | engine native asset formats, VFS, asset database |
| `engine/render` | Vulkan RHI, render graph, TAA, upscalers, raytracing |
| `engine/bethesda` | ESM/ESL/BSA/BA2/NIF readers and converters |
| `engine/world` | cell streaming and gameplay components |
| `engine/net` | server authoritative replication of ECS state |
| `engine/modstream` | content-addressed mod catalog, cache and Vfs mount |
| `engine/rpc` | typed scripting RPC value, wire codec and registry |
| `engine/script` | scripting host, per game Papyrus adapters |
| `runtime` | entry point and main loop |
| `tools` | offline tooling |

## Building

```sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

Vulkan headers and the volk loader are pinned and fetched at configure time,
no SDK install needed. At runtime a Vulkan 1.3 driver is required for
rendering, without one (or without a window) the renderer degrades to a stub.
SDL3 and zlib stay optional at build time: without SDL3 the runtime is
headless (pass `-DRECREATION_FETCH_SDL3=ON` to download it), without zlib
compressed plugin records are rejected at load time.

Targets: Windows, Linux, Android (via the NDK toolchain file).

With Nix, `nix develop` provides the toolchain, SDL3, the Vulkan loader,
validation layers and tools. Configure with the pinned dependency set via
`cmake -B build/nix -G Ninja $RECREATION_FETCHCONTENT_FLAGS`, and launch
Vulkan binaries through the `vkrun` wrapper so the loader and the host GPU
driver are found. `nix build` produces a hermetic build from the same pins.

## Mods

Mod compatibility follows the same rules the original games use. Plugins merge
records with last loaded winning, loose files override archives, and mount
order in the VFS decides priority. Papyrus is game specific and handled by per
game adapters in `engine/script`.

### Multiplayer asset streaming

A server distributes its own UGC to joining players, FiveM style. Point the host
at a mods directory whose immediate subdirectories are resources:

```sh
recreation-server --mods-dir ./server_mods --port 29700
```

The host catalogs every file (content hashed) and offers the manifest on join.
A connecting client diffs it against its local cache, pulls only the content it
is missing over the reliable file transporter, verifies it, and mounts the
resources into its asset Vfs so the host's custom meshes, textures and scripts
resolve like loose files:

```sh
recreation --connect <host> --asset-cache ./cache
```

### Scripting RPC

Server-side mod scripts drive multiplayer through a typed RPC channel. A C# mod
calls `Rpc.Emit(name, args)` (client to host), `Rpc.ToClient(peer, name, args)`
or `Rpc.Broadcast(name, args)` (host to clients), and subscribes with
`Rpc.On(name, e => ...)`. Calls ride the session's reliable channel.
