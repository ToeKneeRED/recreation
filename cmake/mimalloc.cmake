# mimalloc integration (RECREATION_MIMALLOC). Off by default; when on, the engine
# routes allocations through mimalloc for faster, lower-fragmentation heap use.
#
# Two layers of coverage (see the design note in the perf discussion):
#   Layer 1 - C++ operator new/delete. On POSIX these come from mimalloc's own
#             override, pulled in whole (below); on Windows, where a DLL cannot
#             override another module's new/delete, we compile
#             mimalloc-new-delete.h into each executable.
#   Layer 2 - the raw C malloc/free used by third-party libraries and the hosted
#             CLR's native allocations. POSIX: link mimalloc-static WHOLE so its
#             strong malloc/free symbols interpose libc's weak ones across the
#             whole process, including later dlopen'd libraries (the CLR). macOS:
#             the same static library registers a malloc zone at load. Windows has
#             no symbol interposition, so we ship mimalloc.dll + the prebuilt
#             mimalloc-redirect.dll beside the executable (the redirect patches
#             the CRT allocator at startup).
#
# The helper recreation_enable_mimalloc(<target>) is always defined and is a
# no-op when the option is off, so call sites stay unconditional.
